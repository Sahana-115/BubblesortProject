# BubblesortProject
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Here's a description of how you can implement Bubble Sort using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize the sorting process:

How It Works

1. Generate Array:

A random array is generated and displayed as vertical bars, where the height of each bar represents a value.



2. Sorting Visualization:

Bubble sort is implemented using nested loops.

Each iteration compares adjacent bars. If a bar is taller than the next, they are swapped

Highlights show which bars are being compared during each step.



3. Animation:

setTimeout is used to create a delay, making the sorting process visible to the user.
